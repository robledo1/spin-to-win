    <h5>How to play:</h5>
    <p>
        1. Each	player	gets	10	chips to	start.
        2. Everyone	puts	two	chips	in	the	center.		This	is	called	‚Äúthe	pot‚Äù.
        3. Choose	who	will	go	first.
        4. The first player	spins they will then follow the instruction it lands on.
        5. Once	the	first	player‚Äôs	turn	is	complete,	the	next	player	goes and	
        so	on.
        6. If	the	pot	only	has	one	or	two	chips	in	it,	everyone	must	put	2	
        chips	in	at	the	same	time.		If	a	player	cannot	put	2	chips	in,	they	
        are	out	of	the	game.	
        7. Once	you	are	out	of	chips,	you	are	out	of	the	game.	
        8. Continue	playing	until	you	have	a	winner.	
        9. Winning:	The	last	player	who	has	coins	is	the	winner.</p>
